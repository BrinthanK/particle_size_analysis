# Particle shape and size analysis 

This python code will enable reading the DICOM files and preparing for particle size and shape analysis. This code can be employed in any scientific imagery with or without noise. Users should be aware that the preprocessing techniques could affect the results depending on the type of image of interest. Further, proper data cleaning and sorting must be implemented to achieve the extracted feature properly for further plotting purposes. Please be vigilant about the sorting codes committed here. These are specifically written for the image adopted in this program.
